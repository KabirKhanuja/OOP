## 10 C++ Programs to Test Pre-OOP Basics

This set of small programs helps you practice core C++ concepts before diving into OOP.

---

### 1. Basic I/O + Conditionals

- **Program:** Take two integers and print the larger number.
- **Tests:** `cin`, `cout`, `if-else`, basic syntax.

### 2. Looping + Math

- **Program:** Print the sum of digits of an integer.
- **Example:** `456 → 4 + 5 + 6 = 15`
- **Tests:** `while` loop, remainder operator (`%`).

### 3. Functions

- **Program:** Write a function `bool isPrime(int n)` and use it inside `main()`.
- **Tests:** function declaration, definition, return, scope.

### 4. Arrays

- **Program:** Take `N` inputs and find the second-largest number in the array.
- **Tests:** arrays, indexing, iteration.

### 5. Strings

- **Program:** Count vowels in a string.
- **Tests:** `std::string`, `length()`, indexing.

### 6. Pointers

- **Program:** Swap two numbers using pointers (not references).
- **Tests:** pointer basics, dereferencing.

### 7. Pass by Reference

- **Program:** Write a function that takes numbers by reference and multiplies both by `2`.
- **Tests:** references, function parameters.

### 8. Dynamic Memory

- **Program:** Dynamically allocate an integer array using `new`, fill it, and find the average.
- **Tests:** `new`, `delete[]`, pointers with arrays.

### 9. `vector` + STL Basics

- **Program:** Input numbers until `-1` is entered; store them in `std::vector<int>` and sort them.
- **Tests:** `vector`, `push_back`, `sort` from `<algorithm>`.

### 10. File Handling

- **Program:** Write text into a file and read it back.
- **Tests:** `std::fstream`, file open/close, reading/writing.

If you can solve these smoothly, you are ready for OOP topics like:

- Classes & Objects
- Constructors / Destructors
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Operator Overloading
- File handling with objects
